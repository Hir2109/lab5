                <em>I was born</em> on 21st September 2003,I attented my elementary at Prarthana Global Scool.I was an
                introvert kid in my pre schooling days and
                was also a little shy. <br>I was very close to my family in that phase especially to my grandparents.I
                used to visit them on weekends and we all
                would have dinner together. <br> I met many new people in high school and socialised more witb my
                schoolmates.
            </p>
            <p>
                About the achievements, I was assistant event manager in my high school and was able to organise some of
                the most
                spectacular events.<br> I passed my board examinations with 92%(in 10th grade) and 91% in my higher
                secondary education.
                <br> I have also recieved several rewards from my school for inter house competitions in debates,
                singing and many more.
                <br> I also like to do volunteer work however I do not consider it as any kind of achievement.<br>
                I have abilities of problem solving, doing teamwork,stratagic planning and analytical skills as well.

            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been ambitious about programming and learing different languages in that. <br> I want to
                become a software developer
                and design mobile applications, web pages, solutions for enterprise organizations and much more. <br> I
                want to pursue this as
                my carrer due to it's high demand in the industry. I love designing web pages and different
                applications.
